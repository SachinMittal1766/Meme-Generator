# Meme-Generator
Meme-Generator for Kharagpur Winter of Code ( KWoC  2021)

## Project Overview 
Do you like memes? Most people do, so if yes, the idea of developing a meme generator would surely get you going. Being new to React, you can build a simple meme generator that instantly allows users to create memes.

The idea here is to use an API to fetch random meme images and then allow users to place custom text at the top and bottom of the image.

You need to add two different input fields in your meme generator, i.e.:

1st one for the text at the top and the
2nd one for the text at the bottom of the image.
You can also create a database of your own to store meme images and fetch images from the database.

Also, you can enhance the functionality of the meme generator by allowing users to create and log in to their accounts, save memes, and share them on different social media platforms.
